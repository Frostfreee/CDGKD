# Datasets

We evaluate our model on the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets. Both are open-access databases containing laboratory-based physiological recordings, including EEG signals and facial videos. Information on how to obtain it can be found in [DEAP](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/) and [MAHNOB-HCI](https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/) specifically.
